            <p>
              OK, I don't know about you, but I'm tired of that boring Mojo site.
              I want to build something that's <em>useful</em> to me (or us). So, I'm thinking,
              <em>let's build a website for the pre-work</em>. We can go through the process
              step by step.
            </p>
            <p>
              At first, at least, it will just be an old-fashioned
              <mark class="keyword">static website</mark>.But maybe later we'll add some
              CoffeeScript and jQuery and have some fun.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="getting-started">
            <h3>Hooray! So how do we get started?</h3>
            <p>
              Well, the first thing we need to do is to figure out what our site will do,
              and who it will do it for.
            </p>
            <p>
              To this end, we'll begin by creating <mark class="keyword">personas</mark>
              for our audience. I can think of three different types of user who we might
              want to serve.
            </p>
            <p>
              Obviously, there are the <strong>students</strong>: you. You are the primary
              audience as you'll be doing the lessons, so the site should put your needs
              foremost.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then there are the <strong>instructors</strong>, who are also the authors and
              editors of the content. We'll need to think about them a bit, too.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, we might want to show the site off to others: friends, family, the
              course manager, curriculum folks, etc. Let's call them <strong>guests</strong>.
              So we should at least consider their needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              So we'll create three <mark class="keyword">personas</mark>—student,
              instructor, and guest—one for each type of user.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="building-personas">
            <h3>Great! How do we build a persona, then?</h3>
            <p>
              Well, there is <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1cZZfj6">an excellent explanation of personas</a>
              on <a href="http://usability.gov/">the usability.gov website</a>, so rather than reinvent
              the wheel here, go check it out, then come back and we'll build our personas.
            </p>
            <p>
              So let's take a look at our three example personas...

            <h3>Should we really use personas?</h3>
            <p>
              Well, that seems a funny question to ask at this juncture. I mean, we
              just spent a bunch of time <em>making them up</em> (well, I did, anyway). Now
              we're not going to use them?
            </p>
            <p>
              Heh, heh. Not so fast! We might use them, and we might not. It was important
              to create them if for no other reason than <em>because there is a very good chance
              that whatever job you take in the webdev world, you're going to encounter them</em>.
              Better to know how to make them.
            </p>
            <p>
              But there is a minority of developers who think that <mark class="keyword">personas</mark>
              are a <em>bad idea</em>, and they make some very good points. One of the best points is
              that the <mark class="keyword">personas</mark> are made up, and because we are just making
              them up, we tend fill them with our own stereotypes of our users and then fool ourselves
              into thinking that we know something about our users!
            </p>
            <p>
              Gosh, who would do a thing like that? Oh. Yeah. <em>Everyone</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the <mark class="keyword">personas</mark> have been created, most developers
              will create <mark class="keyword">user stories</mark> next. But these, too, have their
              detractors. Let's look at a couple of different ways to create user stories, and then
              see how else we might solve the same problem.

            <h3>So what's the (user) story?</h3>
            <p>
              We need some way to come up with a <mark class="keyword">specification</mark> for our website.
              One of the biggest mistakes that most newbie developers (and many who really oughta know better)
              make is to <em>jump straight into coding</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              As you will soon discover—if you haven't already—the compulsion to do this is almost
              irresistible. I—cough, cough—may have even done it myself on occasion.
            </p>
            <p>
              But jumping straight to the code is what we in the biz call a <strong>Very Bad Idea</strong>™.
              Just. Don't. Do. It.
            </p>
            <p>
              What's the point of spending a lot of time writing code if you're just going to end up throwing it
              all away and redoing it?
            </p>
            <p>
              Here's the <em>right way</em> to build a website or Web application:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Determine who your <mark class="keyword">primary audiences</mark> are and what they want
                (Personas? Maybe.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Determine what your site/application needs to do to meet their needs (User stories?
                Job stories? Hmm. We'll see.)
              </li>
              <li><mark class="keyword">Wireframe</mark> out the first few pages</li>
              <li>Get buy in from the <mark class="keyword">stakeholders</mark></li>
              <li>Now, and only now, write a little bit of code, then iterate through the above again.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              This iterative process (called the <mark class="keyword">Agile Method</mark>) allows us to
              make sure that all the <mark class="keyword">stakeholders</mark> are involved at every step
              of the process, and that mistakes are discovered and corrected quickly. We'll be talking a
              lot about the <mark class="keyword">Agile Method</mark> during WDI. Wait! Talking? We'll
              be doing it. Daily.

          <section id="how-stories-look">
            <h3>Well, what do these stories look like?</h3>
            <dl class="story-formats">
              <dt>The original format from 2001 looked like this:</dt>
              <dd>
                As a <b class="generic-element">[role]</b>,
                I want <b class="generic-element">[goal/desire]</b>
                so that <b class="generic-element">[benefit]</b>
              </dd>

              <dt>Here's an example (from Wikipedia):</dt>
              <dd>
                As a <b class="specific-element">student</b>,
                I want <b class="specific-element">to see estimated times for completion</b>,
                so that <b class="specific-element">I may schedule my lesson better</b>.
              </dd>

              <dt>
                Some developers have a problem with this format, however. They think that
                the benefit should come first (calling it “hunting the value”), so they swap
                it around:
              </dt>
              <dd>
                In order to <b class="generic-element">[receive benefit]</b>
                as a <b class="generic-element">[role]</b>,
                I want <b class="generic-element">[goal/desire]</b>
              </dd>

              <dt>Now we have:</dt>
              <dd>
                So that <b class="specific-element">I may schedule my lessons better</b>,
                as a <b class="specific-element">student</b>,
                I want <b class="specific-element">to see estimated times for completion</b>.
              </dd>

              <dt>
                That worked for a number of years. Then some smart guy pointed out that if you
                drop the role part, you don't really lose anything. And then that lead to yet
                another idea, that of the job story. The job story follows this format:
              </dt>
              <dd>
                When <b class="generic-element">[situation]</b>,
                I want to <b class="generic-element">[motivation]</b>,
                so I can <b class="generic-element">[expected outcome]</b>
              </dd>

              <dt>Here's our user story rewritten as a job story:</dt>
              <dd>
                When <b class="specific-element">I start a lesson</b>,
                I want to <b class="specific-element">know how long it will take to complete it</b>,
                so that I can <b class="specific-element">schedule my time appropriately</b>.
              </dd>
            </dl>

              The truth is this: <em>it probably doesn't matter</em>. What is most important here is
              <em>to stimulate discussion involving all the stakeholders</em>—including, if possible,
              the <em>users themselves</em>—so that the specification—the feature set—is

              <em>iterative</em> process—so why not write a few of your own user or job stories?
              After all, you are the intended users. Send yours to
              <a href="mailto:charles.munat@generalassemb.ly">charles.munat@generalassemb.ly</a>

              OK, assuming we have an idea of who our audience(s) is, and we have a few stories
              to let us know what features we want, the next step is to create a basic
              <mark class="keyword">wireframe</mark> of the page. In this lesson we're just going
              to build a structure for the page, then we'll fill it in with an example lesson
              in our next pre-work installment.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Wikipedia (a very useful resource and one I recommend highly):
              <q cite="./index_files/Website_wireframe">
                A <mark class="keyword">website wireframe</mark>, also known as a
                <mark class="keyword">page schematic</mark> or <mark class="keyword">screen blueprint</mark>,
                is a <em>visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website</em>.
              </q>
            </p>
            <p>
              I used <a href="http://balsamiq.com/">an online wireframing tool called Balsamiq</a>
              to create a very simple structural <mark class="keyword">wireframe</mark> for a typical
              lesson page. Here it is:
            </p>
            <figure id="example-page-basic-wireframe">
              <figcaption>Example page basic wireframe</figcaption>
              <img src="/images/wireframe-000.png" width="940" height="555" alt="">

          <section id="why-so-sketchy">
            <h3>Wait... why does it look so, uh, sketchy?</h3>
            <p>
              That's not an accident! Avoid the temptation to use “pixel perfect” graphics for
              your wireframes! You are not doing the graphic design here. You are working on the
              structure and layout of the page—determining <em>what</em> goes <em>where</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you use something like PhotoShop and you try to make it look like it will look
              with all the design elements in place, then you are getting way ahead of yourself
              and wasting a lot of time. Odds are that this design is going to change many times
              before it is finalized. You really want to waste all that time? Keep it to simple
              sketches until we know what we're going to do.
            </p>
            <p>
              Create an index.html page and code the above structure up (without looking), then
              check your code against mine (see last page). <em>No cheating!</em>
